# Decals
Custom decals for [Pioneer Space Simulator](http://pioneerspacesim.net)to be used with Blender addon [DecalMachine](https://machin3.io/DECALmachine/docs/)

The default custom decals directory is in .../DECALMachine/Assets/CustomDecals. You need to copy the contents of this repository there. Warning: if you have custom decals already, then you will have to overwrite them (I want to fix that later).
